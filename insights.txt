Insights:

Age vs Visit Frequency showed no real relationship, so no segmentation or clustering was done to provide strategic best action
Methodology Used
We applied KMeans clustering to identify customer segments based on behavioral and demographic features. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the elbow method via the plot_elbow function. This method relies on analyzing the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS), which decreases as more clusters are added. The optimal point was chosen where the WCSS curve begins to flatten, indicating diminishing returns in clustering performance.

To prepare the data for clustering, we sliced the original dataframe to isolate relevant feature pairs — such as Age vs Spending Score and Visit Frequency vs Spending Score. Each subset was scaled using a standard scaler to normalize feature ranges before running KMeans, as clustering is sensitive to magnitude differences.

After clustering, we assigned the cluster number to a new column in each respective dataframe, allowing us to analyze customer behavior within each segment. We then applied descriptive labels to each cluster (e.g., "Moderate Spenders", "High Frequency Visitors") to aid interpretation and communication of findings.

We used Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate visualizations that helped illustrate cluster separation and distribution. These included:

Scatter plots to show how clusters differ by feature pair.

Elbow plots to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Pie charts or bar plots to display the relative size of each segment.
Before applying KMeans, these subsets(Age vs Spending Score and Spending Score vs Visit Frequency) were scaled using standard normalization, transforming the features into a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). This ensures that all features contribute equally during clustering.

These visuals, along with centroid statistics, guided our final insights and actionable strategies for each customer group.

Based of off plot_elbow and the cluster distribution from plot_cluster, the amount of clusters to choose from was 3(0,1,2)
Values taken from the plot_avg function which shows the average age and spending score per cluster. Categories were also assigned based on the calc_mean_spending function and an age threshold of 40 to segment customers accordingly

Based off of show_pie_chart
1. Young High Spenders Are the Majority (38.5%)
The largest segment identified is Young High Spenders, with an average age of 28.9 years and an average spending score of 75.36. Their strong presence in the customer base and high engagement with spending behavior make them a priority segment for targeted marketing.
 Actionable Strategy: Focus on premium products, early-access offers, or digital campaigns (e.g., influencer marketing, exclusive promotions) tailored to younger audiences.

2. Older High Spenders and Younger Low Spenders Are Least Represented (10.0% Each)
The two smallest segments are:

Older High Spenders: Likely loyal, high-value customers who could benefit from VIP treatment, personalized rewards, or membership programs.

Younger Low Spenders: Possibly price-sensitive or infrequent buyers. They may be responsive to flash sales, bundling, or gamified reward programs.

 Actionable Strategy:

For older high spenders: Introduce loyalty tiers or curated recommendations.

For younger low spenders: Focus on engagement tactics and entry-level value offers.

3. Clusters Are Visibly Well Separated
The 2D scatter plot of Age vs Spending Score shows clear visual boundaries between the clusters and also shows the centroids of each cluster to provide a holistic view. This indicates that spending behavior and age are strong differentiators in this dataset, especially among younger customers.
 Interpretation: The model’s clustering is both meaningful and robust for segmentation purposes.

Next Segment

Using the KMeans clustering algorithm, we determined the optimal number of clusters (k = 6) via the elbow method. The optimal_k function showed a clear inflection point at k = 6, where the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) began to level off, indicating diminishing returns with additional clusters.

After clustering, we analyzed the centroids of each cluster to assign behavioral labels. However, rather than limiting interpretation to just 6 clusters, we further refined the segments based on a combined logic of visit frequency and spending score, which resulted in 9 customer categories. 
The give_label function is what gave a combination of the behavioral labels based on each customer's spending score and visit frequency against the values from the  avg_visit_freq and avg_spend_score functions.

This post-clustering categorization allowed for a more descriptive and business-relevant segmentation than raw cluster IDs alone.

 nsights: Visit Frequency vs Spending Score
1. High Spender, Frequent Visitor (13.0%) – Your Power Segment
These customers visit often and spend the most. Though only 13%, their high engagement makes them your most valuable segment.

 Actionable Strategy:

Launch VIP loyalty programs or subscription tiers

Offer early access to product launches or exclusive deals

Keep them engaged with personalized experiences

Potentially utilize AI powered engine to provide recommended products or personalized emails

2. Moderate Spend, Moderate/High Frequency (12.5% + 11.0%) – Growth Opportunity
Together, moderate spenders who visit moderately or frequently form over 23% of the base. They’re consistent, but not yet high spenders.

 Actionable Strategy:

Introduce upselling via personalized recommendations

Use email campaigns to highlight higher-value items

Provide “level up” incentives (e.g., spend $10 more for a reward)

3. High Spender, Infrequent Visitor (12.0%) – Valuable But Not Engaged
These are high spenders, but they don’t shop often. Unlocking more visits could greatly increase revenue.

 Actionable Strategy:

Send time-sensitive deals, re-engagement emails, or reminders

Create FOMO-based campaigns (e.g., “You’re missing out!”)

Offer incentives for multiple visits per month

4. Low Spender, Frequent or Moderate Visitors (10.0% + 11.5%) Low Revenue, High Potential
This group visits regularly but spends less — suggesting missed opportunity or price sensitivity.

 Actionable Strategy:

Use bundles or volume discounts to increase basket size to get the most value out of deals

Promote limited-time upsells or “Spend X, Save Y” campaigns

Consider UI/UX or product mix optimizations

5. Low Spender, Infrequent Visitor (10.0%) Low Priority Segment
This group is disengaged on both axes. Re-engagement is possible but ROI may be limited.

 Actionable Strategy:

Use broad reactivation campaigns

Offer entry-level incentives or referral bonuses

Minimal investment unless change in behavior is observed
May have to drill down on AI Engines regarding features such as Right Time optimization to send emails if current workflow doesn't allow
Perhaps try demos

6. High Spender, Moderate Visitor (10.0%) Reliable Value
Steady shoppers with good spend habits. Not as frequent as your top-tier, but worth retaining.

 Actionable Strategy:

Offer occasional perks or event invites to reinforce loyalty

Surprise discounts to boost visit frequency

7. Moderate/Low Spender, Infrequent Visitor (10.0%)  Dormant Group
Hard to activate and low spend potential unless behavior changes.

 Actionable Strategy:

Test A/B re-engagement emails or gamified incentives

Keep them on marketing lists but minimize budget allocation
